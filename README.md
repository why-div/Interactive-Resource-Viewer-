Interactive Resource Viewer (Frontend):

I chose to implement the Interactive Resource Viewer (Frontend) . This is a responsive web interface that organizes machine learning educational resources into weekly modules, allowing users to easily access video tutorials and articles.
Simply open the index.html file in any web browser to run the code or  open the file in vs code .
Chose red (#dc3545) for videos and blue (#0d6efd) for articles.Dark gray module headers for better readability.Clean white cards with subtle shadows for depth.Balanced theoretical and practical resources.Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.Adjusts video player size based on screen width.
